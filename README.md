Thank all guys!!

But I change the code to suit Swift 2.

The most important settings are that two keys should be written in the info.plist:

<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location services required for iBeacon</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Location services required for iBeacon</string>

Good luck.
